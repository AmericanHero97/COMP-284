Programming Exercise 5-9

Modify the Apartment class so that it holds an aptnumber (apartment number), bedrooms (number of bedrooms), baths (number of baths), and rent (rent amount). Create a constructor that accepts values for each data field. Also create a get method for each field.

Modify the TestApartment application so that it creates at least five Apartment objects. Then prompt a user to enter a minimum number of bedrooms required, a minimum number of baths required, and a maximum rent the user is willing to pay. Display data for all the Apartment objects that meet the userâ€™s criteria or No apartments met your criteria if no such apartments are available.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter minimum number of bedrooms needed >> 1
Enter minimum number of bathrooms needed >> 1
Enter maximum rent willing to pay >> 1000

Apartments meeting citeria of
at least 1 bedrooms, at least 1 baths, and  no more than $1000.0 rent:
   Apt #101    2 bedrooms, and 1.0 baths. Rent $725.0
   Apt #102    2 bedrooms, and 1.5 baths. Rent $775.0
   Apt #103    3 bedrooms, and 2.0 baths. Rent $870.0
   Apt #104    3 bedrooms, and 2.5 baths. Rent $960.0
