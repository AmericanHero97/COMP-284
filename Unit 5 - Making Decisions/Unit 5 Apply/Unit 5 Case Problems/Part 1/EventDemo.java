Unit 5 Case Problems

b. In Chapter 4, you modified the EventDemo class to demonstrate two Event objects. Now, modify that class again as follows:
    Instantiate three Event objects, and prompt the user for values for each object.
    Change the method that displays Event details to use the new isLargeEvent() method and the new price per guest value. Use the display method with all three objects.
    Create a method that accepts two Event objects and returns the larger one based on number of guests. (If the Events have the same number of guests, you can return either object.) Call this method three times—once with each pair of instantiated Events—and display the event number and number of guests for each argument as well as the event number and number of guests for the larger Event.
    Save the file as EventDemo.java.
