Unit 5 Case Problems

a. Carly's Catering provides meals for parties and special events. In Chapters 3 and 4, you created an Event class for the company. Now, make the following changes to the class:
    Currently, the class contains a field that holds the price for an Event. Now add another field that holds the price per guest, and add a public method to return its value.
    Currently, the class contains a constant for the price per guest. Replace that field with two fieldsâ€”a lower price per guest that is $32, and a higher price per guest that is $35.
    Add a new method named isLargeEvent() that returns true if the number of guests is 50 or greater and otherwise returns false.
    Modify the method that sets the number of guests so that a large Event (more than 50 guests) uses the lower price per guest to set the new pricePerGuest field and calculate the total Event price. A small Event uses the higher price.
    Save the file as Event.java.
