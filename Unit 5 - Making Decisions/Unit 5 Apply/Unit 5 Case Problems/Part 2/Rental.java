Unit 5 Case Problems

a. Sammy's Seashore Supplies rents beach equipment such as kayaks, canoes, beach chairs, and umbrellas to tourists. In Chapters 3 and 4, you created a Rental class for the company.

Now, make the following change to the class:
    Currently, a rental price is calculated as $40 per hour plus $1 for each minute over a full hour. This means that a customer who rents equipment for 41 or more minutes past an hour pays more than a customer who waits until the next hour to return the equipment. Change the price calculation so that a customer pays $40 for each full hour and $1 for each extra minute up to and including 40 minutes.
