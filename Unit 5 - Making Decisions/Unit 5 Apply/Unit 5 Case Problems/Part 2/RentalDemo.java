Unit 5 Case Problems

b. In Chapter 4, you modified the RentalDemo class to demonstrate a Rental object. Now, modify that class again as follows:
    Instantiate three Rental objects, and prompt the user for values for each object. Display the details for each object to verify that the new price calculation works correctly.
    Create a method that accepts two Rental objects and returns the one with the longer rental time. (If the Rentals have the same time, you can return either object.) Call this method three times—once with each pair of instantiated Rentals—and display the contract number and time in hours and minutes for each argument as well as the contract number of the longer Rental.

Save the file as RentalDemo.java.
