Unit 5 Two Truths & A Lie

1. Two of the following statements are true, and one is false. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. In a sequence structure, one step follows another unconditionally.	
	b. Pseudocode and flowcharts are both tools that are used to check the syntax of computer programs.	[CORRECT]
	c. In a decision structure, alternative courses of action are chosen based on a Boolean value.	

2. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. In a Java if statement, the keyword if is followed by a Boolean expression within parentheses.	
	b. In a Java if statement, a semicolon follows the Boolean expression. [CORRECT]
	c. When determining equivalency in Java, you use a double equal sign.

3. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. Indentation can be used to cause statements following an if statement to depend on the evaluation of the Boolean expression. [CORRECT]
	b. To execute more than one statement that depends on the evaluation of a Boolean expression, you use a pair of curly braces to place the dependent statements within a block.	
	c. When you declare a variable within a block, it is local to that block.	

4. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. When one if statement follows another, the first else clause encountered is paired with the first if that occurred before it. [CORRECT]
	b. A complete nested if…else statement always fits entirely within either the if c portion or the else portion of its outer if…else statement.	
	c. Statements in which an if statement is contained inside another if statement commonly are called nested if statements.

5. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. The AND operator is written as two ampersands ( &&), and the OR operator is written as two pipes ( || ).	
	b. Whether you use an && or || operator, both Boolean expressions are tested in order from left to right. [CORRECT]
	c. When you use the && and || operators, you must include a complete Boolean expression on each side.

6. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. The statement if(payRate < 6.00 && payRate > 50.00) can be used to select payRate values that are higher or lower than the specified limits. [CORRECT]
	b. When you must make a series of decisions in a program, it is most efficient to first ask the question that is most likely to be true.	
	c. A range check is a series of statements that determine within which of a set of ranges a value falls.	

7. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. A break statement bypasses the rest of its switch statement, and execution continues with any statement after the closing curly brace of the switch statement.	
	b. The switch statement is useful when you need to test a single variable against a series of exact integer or character values.	
	c. When you must make more decisions than Java can support, you use a switch statement instead of nested if…else statements. [CORRECT]

8. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. The value of any false expression becomes true when preceded by the NOT operator.	
	b. The NOT operator is written as the exclamation point ( ! ). 
	c. The conditional operator is used as an abbreviated version of the if…else statement and requires two expressions separated with an exclamation point. [CORRECT]

9. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. Assume p, q, and r are all Boolean variables that have been assigned the value true. After the following statement executes, the value of p is still true. [CORRECT]
		p = !(q || !r);	
	b. Assume p, q, and r are all Boolean variables that have been assigned the value true. After the following statement executes, the value of p is still true.
		p = !(!q && !r);	
	c. Assume p, q, and r are all Boolean variables that have been assigned the value true. After the following statement executes, the value of p is still true.
		p = !q || r;
