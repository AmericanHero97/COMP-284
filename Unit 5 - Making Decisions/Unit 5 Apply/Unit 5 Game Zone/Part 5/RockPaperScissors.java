Unit 5 Game Zone

In the game Rock Paper Scissors, two players simultaneously choose one of three options: rock, paper, or scissors. If both players choose the same option, then the result is a tie. However, if they choose differently, the winner is determined as follows:
    Rock beats scissors, because a rock can break a pair of scissors.
    Scissors beats paper, because scissors can cut paper.
    Paper beats rock, because a piece of paper can cover a rock.

Create a game in which the computer randomly chooses rock, paper, or scissors. Let the user enter a number 1, 2, or 3, each representing one of the three choices. Then, determine the winner. Save the application as RockPaperScissors.java. (In the chapter "Characters, Strings, and the StringBuilder," you will modify the game so that the user enters a string for rock, paper, and scissors, rather than just entering a number.)

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
