Unit 5 Game Zone

In Chapter 3, you created a Card class. Modify the Card class so the setValue() method does not allow a Card's value to be less than 1 or higher than 13. If the argument to setValue() is out of range, assign 1 to the Card's value.

In Chapter 3, you also created a PickTwoCards application that randomly selects two playing cards and displays their values. In that application, all Card objects arbitrarily were assigned a suit represented by a single character, but they could have different values, and the player observed which of two Card objects had the higher value. Now, modify the application so both the suit and the value are chosen randomly. Using two Card objects, play a very simple version of the card game War. Deal two Cards—one for the computer and one for the player—and determine the higher card, then display a message indicating whether the cards are equal, the computer won, or the player won. (Playing cards are considered equal when they have the same value, no matter what their suit is.) For this game, assume the Ace (value 1) is low. Make sure that the two Cards dealt are not the same Card. For example, a deck cannot contain more than one Card representing the 2 of Spades. If two cards are chosen to have the same value, change the suit for one of them. Save the application as War.java. (After you study the chapter "Arrays," you will be able to create a more sophisticated War game in which you use an entire deck without repeating cards.)

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
