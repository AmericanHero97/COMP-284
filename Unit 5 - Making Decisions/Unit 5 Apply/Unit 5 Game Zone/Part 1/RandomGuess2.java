/* 

Unit 5 Game Zone

In Chapter 1, you created a class called RandomGuess. In this game, players guess a number, the application generates a random number, and players determine whether they were correct. Now that you can make decisions, modify the application so it allows a player to enter a guess before the random number is displayed, and then displays a message indicating whether the player's guess was correct, too high, or too low. Save the file as RandomGuess2.java. (After you finish Chapter 6, you will be able to modify the application so that the user can continue to guess until the correct answer is entered.)

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
