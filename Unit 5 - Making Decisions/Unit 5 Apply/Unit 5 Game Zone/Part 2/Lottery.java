Unit 5 Game Zone

Create a lottery game application. Generate three random numbers (see Appendix D for help in doing so), each between 0 and 9. Allow the user to guess three numbers. Compare each of the user's guesses to the three random numbers and display a message that includes the user's guess, the randomly determined three-digit number, and the amount of money the user has won as follows:

Matching Numbers                Award ($)

Any one matching                10
Two matching                    100
Three matching, not in order    1,000
Three matching in exact order   1,000,000
No matches                      0

Make certain that your application accommodates repeating digits. For example, if a user guesses 1, 2, and 3, and the randomly generated digits are 1, 1, and 1, do not give the user credit for three correct guessesâ€”just one. Save the file as Lottery.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
