Unit 5 Game Zone

In Chapter 4, you created a Die class from which you could instantiate an object containing a random value from 1 through 6. You also wrote an application that randomly "throws" two dice and displays their values. Modify the application so it determines whether the two dice are the same, the first has a higher value, or the second has a higher value. Save the application as TwoDice2.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
