Programming Exercise 5-4

Write the CellPhoneService program for Horizon Phones, a provider of cellular phone service. Prompt a user for maximum monthly values for talk minutes used, text messages sent, and gigabytes of data used, and then recommend the best plan for the customerâ€™s needs.

A customer who needs fewer than 500 minutes of talk and no text or data should accept Plan A at $49 per month.

A customer who needs fewer than 500 minutes of talk and any text messages should accept Plan B at $55 per month.

A customer who needs 500 or more minutes of talk and no data should accept either Plan C for up to 100 text messages at $61 per month or Plan D for 100 text messages or more at $70 per month.

A customer who needs any data should accept Plan E for up to 3 gigabytes at $79 or Plan F for 3 gigabytes or more at $87.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter talk minutes needed
400
Enter text messages needed
1000
Enter gigabytes of data needed
5
Plan F  $87 per month
