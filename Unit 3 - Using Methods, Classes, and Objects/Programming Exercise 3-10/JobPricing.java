Programming Exercise 3-10

Herbertâ€™s Home Repair estimates each job cost as the cost of materials plus $35 per hour while on the job, plus $12 per hour for travel time to the job site.

The main() method prompts the user for the name of a job (for example, Smith bathroom remodel), the cost of materials, the number of hours of work required, and the number of hours travel time.

Pass the numeric data to a method that computes an estimate for the job and returns the computed value to the main() method which displays the job name and estimated price.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter job descriptpon >> Room 210 Kitchen
Enter cost of materials >> 5,000
Enter hours on the job work >> 120
Enter hours traveling >> 0
The price for Room 210 Kitchen is $9200.0
