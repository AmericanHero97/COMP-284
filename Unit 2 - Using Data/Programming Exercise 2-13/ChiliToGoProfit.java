Programming Exercise 2-13

In the ChiliToGo program in Exercise 12, the costs to produce an adult meal and a childâ€™s meal are $4.35 and $3.10, respectively. Adult meals are sold for $7.00 and children's meals are sold for $4.00. Modify the ChiliToGo program to display the total profit for each type of meal as well as the grand total profit.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter number of adult meals ordered >> 10
Enter number of child meals ordered >> 5
10 adult meals were ordered at 7.0 each.
      Total is 70.0
5 child meals were ordered at 4.0 each.
      Total is 20.0
Grand total for all meals is 90.0
Profits:
      Adult profit is 26.5
      Child profit is 4.5
Total profit is 31.0
