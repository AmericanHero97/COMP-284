Programming Exercises 2-3

Choose the best data type for each of the following so that any reasonable value is accommodated but no memory storage is wasted. Give an example of a typical value that would be held by the variable, and explain why you chose the type you did.

a. the number of siblings you have
b. your final grade in this class
c. the population of Earth
d. the population of a U.S. county
e. the number of passengers on a bus
f. one player's score in a Scrabble game
g. one team's score in a Major League Baseball game
h. the year an historical event occurred
i. the number of legs on an animal
j. the price of an automobile

a. int - the "int" variable type stores whole numbers, and since humans cannot be counted with a decimal, "int" is the only option.
b. char - the "char" variable type stores a single character, this is perfect since we can store such chars for grades like "A", "B", ect.
c. int - the "int" variable type stores whole numbers, and since humans cannot be counted with a decimal, "int" is the only option.
d. int - the "int" variable type stores whole numbers, and since humans cannot be counted with a decimal, "int" is the only option.
e. int - the "int" variable type stores whole numbers, and since humans cannot be counted with a decimal, "int" is the only option.
f. int -  the "int" variable type stores whole numbers, since the score system in Scrabble uses whole numbers, "float" is not needed.
g. int -  the "int" variable type stores whole numbers, and because the MLB scoring system is based off whole numbers, we don't need "float".
h. int -  the "int" variable type stores whole numbers, and since years cannot include decimals, "int" is our only choice.
i. int -  the "int" variable type stores whole numbers, and because the amount of legs cannot be a decimal, we can only use "int" for this case.
j. float - the "float" variable type stores whole numbers with decimals, since we need decimals to calculate the cents in addition to dollars of the purchase, "float" is needed.
