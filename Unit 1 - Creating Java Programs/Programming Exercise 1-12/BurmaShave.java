Programming Exercise 1-12

From 1925 through 1963, Burma Shave advertising signs appeared next to highways all across the United States. There were always four or five signs in a row containing pieces of a rhyme, followed by a final sign that read “Burma Shave.” For example, one set of signs that has been preserved by the Smithsonian Institution reads as follows:

Shaving brushes
You'll soon see 'em
On a shelf
In some museum
Burma Shave

Write, compile, and test a class that outputs five lines so that each displays one line of this Burma Shave slogan in turn.
