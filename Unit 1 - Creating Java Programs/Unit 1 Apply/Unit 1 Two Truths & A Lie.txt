Unit 1 Two Truths & A Lie

1. Two of the following statements are true, and one is false. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
    a. Unlike a low-level programming language, a high-level programming language allows you to use a vocabulary of reasonable terms instead of the sequences of on-and-off switches that perform the corresponding tasks.	
	b. A syntax error occurs when you violate the rules of a language; locating and repairing all syntax errors is part of the process of debugging a program.	
	c. Logic errors are fairly easy to find because the software that translates a program finds all the logic errors for you. [CORRECT]

2. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
    a. Encapsulation protects data by hiding it within an object.	
	b. An instance of a class is a created object that possesses the attributes and methods described in the class definition.	
	c. Polymorphism is the ability to create classes that share the attributes and methods of existing classes, but with more specific features. [CORRECT]

3. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
    a. You can create both console applications and windowed applications using Java.	
	b. After you write a Java program, the compiler converts the source code into a binary program of bytecode.	
	c. Java was developed to be architecturally neutral, which means that anyone can build an application without extensive study. [CORRECT]

4. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. In the method header public static void main(String[] args), the word static means that a method is accessible and usable, even though no objects of the class exist.	
	b. In the method header public static void main(String[] args), the word public is an access specifier.	
	c. In the method header public static void main(String[] args), the word void means that the main() method is an empty method. [CORRECT]

5. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
    a. When you compile a class, you create a new file with the same name as the original file but with a .class extension.	
	b. Syntax errors are compile-time errors.	
	c. After you write and save an application, you can compile the bytecode to create source code. [CORRECT]

6. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
    a. To compile a file named MyProgram.java, you type java MyProgram, but to execute the program you type java MyProgram.java. [CORRECT]
	b. When you compile a program, sometimes one error in syntax causes multiple error messages.	
	c. In Java, if a class is public, you must save the class in a file with exactly the same name and a .java extension.

7. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
    a. Block comments start with a forward slash and an asterisk ( /* ) and end with an asterisk and a forward slash ( */ ); they can extend across as many lines as needed.	
	b. Javadoc comments begin with a forward slash and two asterisks ( /** ) and end with an asterisk and a forward slash ( */ ); they are used to generate documentation with a program named javadoc.	
	c. Line comments start with two forward slashes ( // ) and end with two backslashes ( \\ ); they can extend across as many lines as needed. [CORRECT]

8. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
    a. A dialog box is a GUI object resembling a window, in which you can place messages you want to display.	
	b. Different methods can require different numbers of arguments.	
	c. You use an append statement when you want to access a built-in Java class that is contained in a group of classes called a package. [CORRECT]
