Programming Exercise 9-6

Write the TimesAndInstructors application that stores at least five different college courses (such as CIS101), the time it first meets in the week (such as Mon 9 am), and the instructor (such as Farrell) in a two-dimensional array.

Allow the user to enter a course name and display the corresponding time and instructor. If the course exists twice, display details for both sessions. If the course does not exist, display Invalid Entry: No Such Course.

Use the following values:

Course	Time	Instructor
CIS101	Mon 9 am	Farrell
CIS210	Mon 11 am	Patel
MKT100	Tues 8:30 am	Wong
ACC150	Tues 6 pm	Deitrich
CIS101	Fri 1 pm	Lennon


An example of the program is shown below:

Enter a course:
MKT100
Course: MKT100 Time: Tues 8:30 am Instructor: Wong
