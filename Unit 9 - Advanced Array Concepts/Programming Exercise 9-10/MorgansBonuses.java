Programming Exercise 9-10

Morganâ€™s Department Store distributes bonuses to its salespeople after the holiday rush. Table 9-6 shows the bonuses, which are based on full weeks worked during the season and the number of positive online customer reviews. Write a program that allows a user to continuously enter values for the number of weeks worked and the number of positive reviews received and displays the appropriate bonus until the user enter a sentinel value: 99.
