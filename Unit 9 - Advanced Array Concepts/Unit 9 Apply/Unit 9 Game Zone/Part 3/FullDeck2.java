/* 

Unit 9 Game Zone

In Chapter 8, you created an application class named FullDeck that implemented a 52-element array that represented each card in a standard deck of playing cards. Now, create an enumeration that holds the four suits SPADES, HEARTS, DIAMONDS, and CLUBS. Save the enumeration in a file named Suit.java. Modify the Card class from Chapter 8 to use the enumeration, and save the class as Card2.java. Modify the FullDeck application to use the new Card2 class, and save the application as FullDeck2.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
