Unit 9 Two Truths & A Lie

1. Two of the following statements are true, and one is false. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. In an ascending bubble sort, you compare pairs of items, swapping them if they are out of order, so that the largest items "bubble" to the top of the list, eventually creating a sorted list. [CORRECT]
	b. When you make a swap while sorting an array of objects, you typically swap entire objects and not just the field on which the comparison is made.	
	c. When you sort objects, you usually want to sort based on a particular object field.	

2. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. You can create an ascending list using an insertion sort, but not a descending one. [CORRECT]
	b. When you use an insertion sort, you look at each list element one at a time and move items down if the tested element should be inserted before them.	
	c. The insertion sort is similar to the technique you might use to sort a group of objects manually.	

3. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. The following array contains two columns and three rows: [CORRECT]
		int[][] myArray = { { 12, 14, 19},
							  33, 45, 88} };
	b. Two-dimensional arrays have both rows and columns, so you must use two subscripts when you access an element in a two-dimensional array.	
	c. With a two-dimensional array, the length field holds the number of rows in the array; each row has a length field that holds the number of columns in the row.

4. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. You can use the Arrays class binarySearch() method successfully on any array as soon as you have assigned values to the array elements. [CORRECT]
	b. The Arrays class contains methods for manipulating arrays, such as binarySearch(), fill(), and sort().	
	c. The binarySearch() method works by continuously deciding whether the element sought is above or below the halfway point in sublists of the original list.	

5. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. An advantage of the ArrayList class over the Arrays class is that an ArrayList is dynamically resizable.	
	b. An advantage of the ArrayList class over the Arrays class is that it can hold multiple object types.	
	c. An advantage of the ArrayList class over the Arrays class is that it can hold primitive data types such as int and double. [CORRECT]

6. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	Assume that you have coded the following:
	enum Color {RED, WHITE, BLUE};
	Color myColor = Color.RED;

	a. The value of myColor.compareTo(Color.RED) is 0.	
	b. The value of myColor.ordinal() is 1.	[CORRECT]
	c. The value of myColor < Color.WHITE is true.
