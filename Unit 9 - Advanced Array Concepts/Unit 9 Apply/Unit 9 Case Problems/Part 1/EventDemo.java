Unit 9 Case Problems

In Chapter 8, you modified the EventDemo program for Carly's Catering to accept and display data for an array of three Event objects. Now, modify the program to use an array of eight Event objects. Prompt the user to choose an option to sort Events in ascending order by event number, number of guests, or event type. Display the sorted list, and continue to prompt the user for sorting options until the user enters a sentinel value. Save the file as EventDemo.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
