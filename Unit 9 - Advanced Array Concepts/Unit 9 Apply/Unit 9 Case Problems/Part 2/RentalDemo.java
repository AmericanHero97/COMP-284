Unit 9 Case Problems

In Chapter 8, you modified the RentalDemo program for Sammy's Seashore Supplies to accept and display data for an array of three Rental objects. Now, modify the program to use an array of eight Rental objects. Prompt the user to choose an option to sort Rentals in ascending order by contract number, price, or equipment type. Display the sorted list, and continue to prompt the user for sorting options until the user enters a sentinel value. Save the file as RentalDemo.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
