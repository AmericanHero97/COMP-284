Programming Exercise 9-3A

Radio station KJAVA wants a class to keep track of recordings it plays. Create a class named Recording that contains fields to hold methods for setting and getting a Recording’s title, artist, and playing time in seconds.

Implement the RecordingSort application that instantiates five Recording objects and prompts the user for values for the data fields. Then prompt the user to enter which field the Recordings should be sorted by—(S)ong title, (A)rtist, or playing (T)ime. Perform the requested sort procedure, and display the Recording objects.

The getter and setter methods for the song, artist, and playTime variables must be defined in the Recording class.

An example of the program is shown below:

Enter a song for recording 1
BlindingLights
Enter an artist for recording 1
TheWeekend
Enter the time for the recording in seconds 1
203
Enter a song for recording 2
Circles
Enter an artist for recording 2
PostMalone
Enter the time for the recording in seconds 2
227
Enter a song for recording 3
DontStartNow
Enter an artist for recording 3
DuaLipa
Enter the time for the recording in seconds 3
204
Enter a song for recording 4
AdoreYou
Enter an artist for recording 4
HarryStyles
Enter the time for the recording in seconds 4
219
Enter a song for recording 5
