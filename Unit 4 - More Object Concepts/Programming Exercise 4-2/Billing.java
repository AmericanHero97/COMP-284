Programming Exercise 4-2

Modify the class named Billing that includes three overloaded computeBill() methods for a photo book store.

• When computeBill() receives a single parameter, it represents the price of one photo book ordered. Add 8% tax, and return the total due.

• When computeBill() receives two parameters, they represent the price of a photo book and the quantity ordered. Multiply the two values, add 8% tax, and return the total due.

• When computeBill() receives three parameters, they represent the price of a photo book, the quantity ordered, and a coupon value. Multiply the quantity and price, reduce the result by the coupon value, and then add 8% tax and return the total due.
