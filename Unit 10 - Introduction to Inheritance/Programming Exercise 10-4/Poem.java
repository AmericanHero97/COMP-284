Debugging Exercise 10-4

Create a class named Poem that contains the following fields:

title - the name of the poem (of type String)
lines - the number of lines in the poem (of type int)
Include a constructor that requires values for both fields. Also include get methods to retrieve field values. Create three subclasses: Couplet, Limerick, and Haiku. The constructor for each subclass requires only a title; the lines field is set using a constant value. A couplet has two lines, a limerick has five lines, and a haiku has three lines.

An example of the DemoPoems program is shown below:

Poem: The Raven   Lines: 84
Poem: True Wit   Lines: 2
Poem: There was an Old Man with a Beard   Lines: 5
Poem: The Wren   Lines: 3

public class Poem {
    // Define the Poem class here
