Debugging Exercise 10-1

Create a class named Horse that contains the following data fields:

name - of type String
color - of type String
birthYear - of type int
Include get and set methods for these fields.

Next, create a subclass named RaceHorse, which contains an additional field, races (of type int), that holds the number of races in which the horse has competed and additional methods to get and set the new field.

An example of the DemoHorses program is shown below:

Old Paint is brown and was born in 2009.
Champion is black and was born in 2011.
Champion has been in 4 races.

public class DemoHorses {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Horse horse1 = new Horse();
        RaceHorse horse2 = new RaceHorse();
        
        horse1.setName("Old Paint");
        horse1.setColor("brown");
        horse1.setBirthYear(2009);
        horse2.setName("Champion");
        horse2.setColor("black");
        horse2.setBirthYear(2011);
        horse2.setRaces(4);

        System.out.println(horse1.getName() + " is " + horse1.getColor() + " and was born in " + horse1.getBirthYear() + ".");
        System.out.println(horse2.getName() + " is " + horse2.getColor() + " and was born in " + horse2.getBirthYear() + ".");
        System.out.println(horse2.getName() + " has been in " + horse2.getRaces() + " races.");
    }
