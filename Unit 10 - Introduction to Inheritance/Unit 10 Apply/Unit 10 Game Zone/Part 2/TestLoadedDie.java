Unit 10 Game Zone

a. In Chapter 4, you created a Die class that you can use to instantiate objects that hold one of six randomly selected values. Modify this class so its value field is protected instead of private. This will allow a child class to access the value. Save the file as Die.java.
b. Create a LoadedDie class that can be used to give a player a slight advantage over the computer. A LoadedDie never rolls a 1; it rolls only values 2 through 6. Save the file as LoadedDie.java.
c. Create a program that rolls two Die objects against each other 1,000 times and counts the number of times the first Die has a higher value than the other Die. Then roll a Die object against a LoadedDie object 1,000 times, and count the number of times the Die wins. Display the results. Save the application as TestLoadedDie.java. Figure 10-31 shows two typical executions.
