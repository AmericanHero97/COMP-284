Unit 10 Game Zone

a. Create an Alien class. Include at least three protected data members of your choice, such as the number of eyes the Alien has. Include a constructor that requires a value for each data field and a toString() method that returns a String containing a complete description of the Alien. Save the file as Alien.java.
b. Create two classes—Martian and Jupiterian—that descend from Alien. Supply each with a constructor that sets the Alien data fields with values you choose. For example, you can decide that a Martian has four eyes but a Jupiterian has only two. Save the files as Martian.java and Jupiterian.java.
c. Create an application that instantiates one Martian and one Jupiterian. Call the toString() method with each object and display the results. Save the application as CreateAliens.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
