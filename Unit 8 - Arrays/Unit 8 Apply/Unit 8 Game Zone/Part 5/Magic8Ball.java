/* 

Magic 8 Ball is a toy developed in the 1950s and used for fortune-telling or advice-seeking. A player asks or thinks of a yes-or-no question such as, Will I be rich someday? The player then turns the ball over to see one of 20 randomly chosen responses, for example, It is certain or Very doubtful. Create a program that simulates the toy by allowing a user to type a question; the user then receives one of 20 random responses. Allow the user to keep asking questions until the user types in a sentinel value. 

Save the program as Magic8Ball.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
