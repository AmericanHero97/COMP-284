Unit 8 Game Zone

a. In Chapter 4, you created a Die application that randomly "throws" five dice for the computer and five dice for the player. The application displays the values. Modify the application to decide the winner based on the following hierarchy of Die values. Any higher combination beats a lower oneâ€”for example, five of a kind beats four of a kind.

-Five of a kind
-Four of a kind
-Three of a kind
-A pair

Figure 8-21 Typical execution of the FiveDice2 application

For this game, the dice values do not count; for example, if both players have three of a kind, it's a tie, no matter what the values of the three dice are. Additionally, the game does not recognize other poker hand type combinations such as a full house (three of a kind plus two of a kind) or a straight (sequential values). Figure 8-21 shows a sample execution. Save the application as FiveDice2.java.

b. Improve the FiveDice2 game so that when both players have the same combination of dice, the higher value wins. For example, two 6s beats two 5s. 

Save the application as FiveDice3.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
