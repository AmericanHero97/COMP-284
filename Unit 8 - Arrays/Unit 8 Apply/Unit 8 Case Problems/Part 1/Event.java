Unit 8 Case Problems

In previous chapters, you developed classes that work with catering event information for Carly's Catering. Now modify the Event and EventDemo classes as follows:

-Modify the Event class to include an integer field that holds an event type. Add a final String array that holds names of the types of events that Carly's catersâ€”wedding, baptism, birthday, corporate, and other. Include get and set methods for the integer event type field. If the argument passed to the method that sets the event type is larger than the size of the array of String event types, then set the integer to the element number occupied by other. Include a get method that returns an event's String event type based on the numeric event type.
-To keep the EventDemo class simple, remove all the statements that compare event sizes and that display the invitation Strings.
-Modify the EventDemo class so that instead of creating three single Event objects, it uses an array of three Event objects. Get data for each of the objects, and then display all the details for each object.

Save the files as Event.java and EventDemo.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
