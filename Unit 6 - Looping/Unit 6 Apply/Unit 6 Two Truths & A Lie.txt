Unit 6 Two Truths & A Lie

1. Two of the following statements are true, and one is false. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. A loop is a structure that allows repeated execution of a block of statements as long as a tested expression is true.	
	b. If a loop's tested Boolean expression is true, a block of statements called the loop body executes before the Boolean expression is evaluated again.	
	c. When the Boolean evaluation tested in a loop becomes false, the loop body executes one last time. CC

2. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. A finite loop executes a specific number of times; an indefinite loop is one that never ends. CC	
	b. A well-written while loop contains an initialized loop control variable that is tested in the while expression and then altered in the loop body.	
	c. In an indefinite loop, you don't know how many times the loop will occur

3. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. Assume that x = 4 and y = 5. The value of y += x is 9.	
	b. Assume that x = 4 and y = 5. The value of ++y + ++x is 11.	
	c. Assume that x = 4 and y = 5. The value of y == x++ is true. CC

4. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. Within the parentheses of a for loop, the last section must alter the loop control variable. CC
	b. The body of a for loop might never execute.	
	c. A for loop must always contain two semicolons within its parentheses.

5. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. When the body of a do…while loop contains a single statement, you do not need to use curly braces to block the statement.	
	b. When the statements in a loop body must execute at least one time, it is convenient to use a do…while loop.	
	c. The do…while loop checks the value of the loop control variable at the top of the loop prior to loop execution. CC

6. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. The body of the following loop executes 20 times:
		for(int x = 0; x < 4; ++x)
		for(int y = 0; y < 5; ++y)
		System.out.println("Hi");	
	b. You can place a while loop within a while loop or a for loop within a for loop, but you cannot mix loop types. CC
	c. An inner nested loop must be entirely contained within its outer loop.

7. Identify the false statement and explain why it is false.
	a. You can improve loop performance when two conditions must both be true by testing for the most likely occurrence first. CC	
	b. You can improve loop performance by making sure the loop does not include unnecessary operations in the body of the loop.	
	c. You can improve the performance of a loop by making sure the loop does not include unnecessary operations in the tested expression.
