a. Write an application that creates a quiz. The quiz should contain at least five questions about a hobby, popular music, astronomy, or any other personal interest. Each question should be a multiple-choice question with at least four answer options. When the user answers the question correctly, display a congratulatory message. If the user responds to a question incorrectly, display an appropriate message as well as the correct answer. At the end of the quiz, display the number of correct and incorrect answers, and the percentage of correct answers. Save the file as Quiz.java.

b. Modify the Quiz application so that the user is presented with each question continually until it is answered correctly. Remove the calculation for percentage of correct answersâ€”all users will have 100% correct by the time they complete the application. Save the file as Quiz2.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
