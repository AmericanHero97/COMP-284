/* 

Unit 6 Game Zone

In Chapter 4, you created a Die class from which you could instantiate an object containing a random value from 1 through 6. Now use the class to create a simple dice game in which the user chooses a number between 2 (the lowest total possible from two dice) and 12 (the highest total possible). The user "rolls" two dice up to three times. If the number chosen by the user comes up, the user wins and the game ends. If the number does not come up within three rolls, the computer wins. Save the application as TwoDice3.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
