Unit 6 Game Zone

Two people play the game of Count 21 by taking turns entering a 1, 2, or 3, which is added to a running total. The player who adds the value that makes the total reach or exceed 21 loses the game. Create a game of Count 21 in which a player competes against the computer, and program a strategy that always allows the computer to win. On any turn, if the player enters a value other than 1, 2, or 3, force the player to reenter the value. Save the game as Count21.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
