Unit 6 Game Zone

In Chapter 1, you created a class called RandomGuess. In this game, players guess a number, the application generates a random number, and players determine whether they were correct. In Chapter 5, you improved the application to display a message indicating whether the player's guess was correct, too high, or too low. Now, add a loop that continuously prompts the user for the number, indicating whether the guess is high or low, until the user enters the correct value. After the user correctly guesses the number, display a count of the number of attempts it took. Save the file as RandomGuess3.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
