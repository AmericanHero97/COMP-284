Unit 6 Case Problems

Carly's Catering provides meals for parties and special events. In previous chapters, you developed a class that holds catering event information and an application that tests the methods using three objects of the class. Now modify the EventDemo class to do the following:
    Continuously prompt for the number of guests for each Event until the value falls between 5 and 100 inclusive.
    For one of the Event objects, create a loop that displays Please come to my event! as many times as there are guests for the Event.

Save the modified file as EventDemo.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
