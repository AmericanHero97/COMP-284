Unit 6 Case Problems

Sammy's Seashore Supplies rents beach equipment to tourists. In previous chapters, you developed a class that holds equipment rental information and an application that tests the methods using three objects of the class. Now modify the RentalDemo class to do the following:
    Continuously prompt for the number of minutes of each Rental until the value falls between 60 and 7,200 inclusive.
    For one of the Rental objects, create a loop that displays Coupon good for 10percent off next rental as many times as there are full hours in the Rental.

Save the modified file as RentalDemo.java.

Create a zip file of the .java file(s) and submit the assignment.
