Programming Exercise 6-7

In Chapter 1 Programming Exercise 9 you created a program named Triangle in which you displayed a seven-line triangle pattern like the one in Figure 6-33 by using a series of println() statements. Now, using your knowledge of loops, revise the program so that it contains no more than three output statements.
