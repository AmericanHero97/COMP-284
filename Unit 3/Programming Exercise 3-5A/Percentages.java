Programming Exercise 3-5A

Create an application named Percentages whose main() method holds two double variables. Assign values to the variables.

Pass both variables to a method named computePercent() that displays the two values and the value of the first number as a percentage of the second one. For example, if the numbers are 2.0 and 5.0, the method should display a statement similar to “2.0 is 40.0 percent of 5.0.”

Then call the method a second time, passing the values in reverse order.

For testing use the values 2.0 and 5.0.

An example of the program is shown below:

2.0 is 40.0 percent of 5.0
5.0 is 250.0 percent of 2.0
