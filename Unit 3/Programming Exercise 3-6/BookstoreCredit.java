Programming Exercise 3-6

To encourage good grades, Hermosa High School has decided to award each student a bookstore credit that is 10 times the student’s grade point average.

In other words, a student with a 3.2 grade point average receives a $32.0 credit.

Create an application that prompts a student for a name and grade point average, and then passes the values to a method (computeDiscount) that displays a descriptive message. The message uses the student’s name, echoes the grade point average, and computes and displays the credit, as follows: John, your GPA is 3.4, so your credit is $34.0.
